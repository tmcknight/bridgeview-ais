# Contributing to BridgeView AIS

Thanks for your interest in contributing to BridgeView AIS! This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing.

## Project Scope

This project is intentionally focused on a fairly specific use case - tracking ship traffic near the Blue Water Bridge. It's designed as a personal tool for hanging out by the bridge and watching ships go by. Making this into something bigger or more general-purpose isn't planned at this time. Contributions that enhance the core experience are welcome, but major scope expansions or feature additions that go beyond this focused use case may not align with the project's goals.
